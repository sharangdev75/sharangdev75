<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shang Srivastava</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Enthusiastic Data Scientist/Analyst</h3>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Football Player Performance Analysis: In this project, I am evaluating the performance of football players. The analysis involves gathering data on player statistics such as goals, assists, and defensive actions. I am also considering advanced metrics like expected goals (xG), passing accuracy, and player positioning during matches. The goal is to assess a player's impact on their team's performance and provide insights for clubs, scouts, and fans. This analysis relies heavily on football data sources and Python-based tools for data analysis and visualization.**

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **As part of my ongoing learning in AWS Data Analytics, I am gaining expertise in several essential AWS services. Here's a summary of what I am currently learning: 1. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose: I am exploring Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, which is a fully managed service that can capture, transform, and load (ETL) streaming data in real-time. It enables seamless integration with various AWS services, including Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift, making it ideal for ingesting and processing large volumes of data streams efficiently. 2. AWS Glue ETL: AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that simplifies the process of preparing and loading data for analytics. I am learning how to use AWS Glue to automate data transformation tasks, making data ready for analysis in services like Amazon Redshift and Amazon Athena. 3. Amazon Athena: Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive query service that allows for querying data in Amazon S3 using SQL. I am acquiring skills to perform ad-hoc queries and gain insights from data stored in Amazon S3 using Athena's powerful querying capabilities. 4. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): I am learning how to effectively use Amazon S3 as a scalable and secure storage solution for data. It's a fundamental component in AWS data analytics, providing a reliable and cost-effective way to store and access data. 5. Amazon QuickSight: Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-native business intelligence (BI) service that I am exploring to create interactive dashboards and visualizations. It enables me to gain insights from data stored in AWS services and present them in a user-friendly manner. 6. Amazon DynamoDB: I am also learning about Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service. It's crucial for handling structured data and is often used in conjunction with other AWS data analytics services. By mastering these AWS Data Analytics services, I aim to become proficient in designing, building, and managing data analytics solutions on the AWS cloud platform, providing valuable insights to businesses and organizations.**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **2. Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Stock Market (X): In this analysis, I am examining how sentiments expressed on Twitter (X) affect the stock market. I collect and analyze tweets related to specific companies and their stock symbols. Natural language processing techniques are used to determine sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and assess the overall market sentiment. This analysis is valuable for traders, investors, and financial institutions seeking to gauge market sentiment in real-time. Both analyses involve data collection, cleaning, and utilizing tools such as Python, R, and Tableau for visualization. The goal is to provide actionable insights based on data-driven analysis.**

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Machine Learning Techniques in Finance: Predictive Modeling: How can machine learning models predict stock prices or market trends based on historical data? Fraud Detection: What machine learning algorithms are effective for detecting fraudulent financial transactions? Credit Scoring: How do machine learning techniques contribute to credit risk assessment for lending institutions? Portfolio Optimization: Can machine learning be used to optimize investment portfolios and manage risk? AWS Data Analytics Services for Financial Data: AWS SageMaker: What is SageMaker, and how can it be utilized for training and deploying machine learning models in the financial domain? Amazon Redshift: How does Amazon Redshift enable data warehousing and analytics for financial data at scale? Amazon Quicksight: Can you provide insights on creating financial dashboards and visualizations using QuickSight? AWS Glue: How does AWS Glue assist in data preparation and ETL processes for financial data analysis? Feel free to ask any questions related to these topics, and I'll provide insights and guidance on how Machine Learning and AWS Data Analytics can be leveraged effectively in the realm of financial data analysis.**
