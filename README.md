<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Shang Srivastava</h1>
<h3 align="center">An Enthusiastic Data Scientist/Analyst</h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **📊 Football Player Performance Analysis 📈. In this project, I'm evaluating the performance of ⚽ football players. The analysis involves gathering data on player statistics such as ⚽ goals, 🅰️ assists, and defensive actions. I'm also considering advanced metrics like 🎯 expected goals (xG), 📊 passing accuracy, and 📍 player positioning during matches. The goal is to assess a player's impact on their team's performance and provide insights for 🏆 clubs, 🔍 scouts, and 👥 fans. This analysis relies heavily on football data sources and 🐍 Python-based tools for data analysis.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **📊 AWS Data Analytics 🚀. As part of my ongoing learning in AWS Data Analytics, I am gaining expertise in several essential AWS services. Here's a summary of what I am currently learning:
  - Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose 🔥: I am exploring Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, which is a fully managed service that can capture, transform, and load (ETL) streaming data in real-time. It enables seamless integration with various AWS services, including Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift, making it ideal for ingesting and processing large volumes of data streams efficiently.
  - AWS Glue ETL 🧩: AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that simplifies the process of preparing and loading data for analytics. I am learning how to use AWS Glue to automate data transformation tasks, making data ready for analysis in services like Amazon Redshift and Amazon Athena.
  - Amazon Athena 📊: Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive query service that allows for querying data in Amazon S3 using SQL. I am acquiring skills to perform ad-hoc queries and gain insights from data stored in Amazon S3 using Athena's powerful querying capabilities.
  - Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) 📦: I am learning how to effectively use Amazon S3 as a scalable and secure storage solution for data. It's a fundamental component in AWS data analytics, providing a reliable and cost-effective way to store and access data.
  - Amazon QuickSight 📈: Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-native business intelligence (BI) service that I am exploring to create interactive dashboards and visualizations. It enables me to gain insights from data stored in AWS services and present them in a user-friendly manner.
  - Amazon DynamoDB 💡: I am also learning about Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service. It's crucial for handling structured data and is often used in conjunction with other AWS data analytics services.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **examining how sentiments expressed on Twitter (X) affect the stock market. I collect and analyze tweets related to specific companies and their stock symbols. 📊 Natural language processing techniques are used to determine sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and assess the overall market sentiment. This analysis is valuable for traders, investors, and financial institutions seeking to gauge market sentiment in real-time. 💼📉 Both analyses involve data collection, cleaning, and utilizing tools such as 🐍 Python, 📊 R, and 📈 Tableau for visualization. The goal is to provide actionable insights based on data-driven analysis. 📈🔍**

- 💬 Ask me about **📈 Predictive Modeling in Finance: Machine learning models 🤖📊 can predict stock prices or market trends based on historical data by analyzing patterns and relationships in the data. Techniques like time series analysis, regression, and deep learning can be employed to make predictions. 📈📉 🔍 Fraud Detection: Effective machine learning algorithms 🧐🕵️‍♂️ for detecting fraudulent financial transactions include Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. These algorithms analyze transaction patterns and identify anomalies indicative of fraud. 💳🚫 💳 Credit Scoring: Machine learning contributes to credit risk assessment by analyzing an applicant's financial history, credit utilization, and other factors. Models like logistic regression and gradient boosting can predict creditworthiness. 📊💰 📊 Portfolio Optimization: Machine learning can optimize investment portfolios by considering risk and return. Techniques like Mean-Variance Optimization and Reinforcement Learning can help balance the portfolio for maximum returns with acceptable risk. 📈📊 🛠️ AWS SageMaker: Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. In finance, it can be used to develop predictive models for stock prices or fraud detection. SageMaker streamlines the machine learning lifecycle, making it efficient for financial applications. ☁️🤖 🚀 Amazon Redshift: Amazon Redshift is a data warehousing and analytics service that can handle large-scale financial data. It enables high-performance querying and analysis, making it suitable for financial data analysis and reporting. 📊🔍 📊 Amazon QuickSight: Amazon QuickSight is a BI service that helps create financial dashboards and visualizations. It allows you to present financial data in a user-friendly manner, aiding in decision-making. 📈📊 🧩 AWS Glue: AWS Glue simplifies data preparation and ETL processes for financial data analysis. It automates data transformation tasks, ensuring data is ready for analysis in services like Redshift and Athena. 🛠️📊💼**
