### 🔭 Current Projects:
- **Football Player Performance Analysis 📊**:
  - Evaluating ⚽ football players' performance.
  - Analyzing statistics like ⚽ goals, 🅰️ assists, and defensive actions.
  - Using advanced metrics like 🎯 expected goals (xG) and 📊 passing accuracy.
  - Providing insights for 🏆 clubs, 🔍 scouts, and 👥 fans.
  - Utilizing Python-based tools for data analysis.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **📊 AWS Data Analytics 🚀. As part of my ongoing learning in AWS Data Analytics, I am gaining expertise in several essential AWS services. Here's a summary of what I am currently learning:
  - Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose 🔥: I am exploring Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, which is a fully managed service that can capture, transform, and load (ETL) streaming data in real-time. It enables seamless integration with various AWS services, including Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift, making it ideal for ingesting and processing large volumes of data streams efficiently.
  - AWS Glue ETL 🧩: AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that simplifies the process of preparing and loading data for analytics. I am learning how to use AWS Glue to automate data transformation tasks, making data ready for analysis in services like Amazon Redshift and Amazon Athena.
  - Amazon Athena 📊: Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive query service that allows for querying data in Amazon S3 using SQL. I am acquiring skills to perform ad-hoc queries and gain insights from data stored in Amazon S3 using Athena's powerful querying capabilities.
  - Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) 📦: I am learning how to effectively use Amazon S3 as a scalable and secure storage solution for data. It's a fundamental component in AWS data analytics, providing a reliable and cost-effective way to store and access data.
  - Amazon QuickSight 📈: Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-native business intelligence (BI) service that I am exploring to create interactive dashboards and visualizations. It enables me to gain insights from data stored in AWS services and present them in a user-friendly manner.
  - Amazon DynamoDB 💡: I am also learning about Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service. It's crucial for handling structured data and is often used in conjunction with other AWS data analytics services.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **examining how sentiments expressed on Twitter (X) affect the stock market. I collect and analyze tweets related to specific companies and their stock symbols. 📊 Natural language processing techniques are used to determine sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and assess the overall market sentiment. This analysis is valuable for traders, investors, and financial institutions seeking to gauge market sentiment in real-time. 💼📉 Both analyses involve data collection, cleaning, and utilizing tools such as 🐍 Python and 📈 Tableau for visualization. The goal is to provide actionable insights based on data-driven analysis. 📈🔍**

- **Sentiment Analysis on Twitter for Stock Market 📊**:
